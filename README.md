# whatSnack
A little app to send the snack menu as a text message every night.  So far is just a simple webapp that sends a text message using the twilio api from a 909 area code phone number (Uplands,CA).  Trying to work on sending periodic messages with data parsed from the snack menu at Collins dining hall

To get it to work (so far):
(1) Download the php file onto WebServer and put in a folder called whatSnack
(2) Download the twilio php source code and save it in the whatSnack folder on the WebServer.  Download twilio-php form here -> https://www.twilio.com/docs/php/install#installation
(2) run the html
